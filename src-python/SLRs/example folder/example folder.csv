inproceedings,"Collaborative research into Game Jams, Hackathons and Event-Based Teaching in Higher Education (Abstract Only)","The idea for this session is based on conversations with colleagues from computer science, art, communications, engineering, and biology as well as international colleagues from three continents at ITICSE-2016 on the use of Game Jams to increase participation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Computer Science and STEM education. High-impact practices are powerful tools in engaging students (NSSE, 2014), perhaps even more so for non-traditional, ESL/ELL, first-generation, and URM students in STEM disciplines by increasing peer and faculty contact, active learning, and high expectations (Goodman). We believe that event-based teaching, such as Game jams and Hackathons provide students with many, if not more of the experiences that are credited with those of commonly identified High Impact Practices (Kuh, 2008).These events also create peer and social networks among participants. While not conclusive - anecdotally the networks of peers and social capacity seem to make a difference in post graduation job search (Mouw). Game Jams and Hackathons are still relatively new in higher education, and while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence as to the benefits reaped by participants of these events, there exists little in the way of long-term studies in the literature that speaks to the academic value of these events.This session will create a conversation among faculty from computer science and other disciplines who are interested in creating these events and their institutions, and developing scholarship to fill in the gaps in the literature around the effects and efficacy of these events on the long-term success of participants.","Pollock, Ian and Brooks, Lonny","collaborative research, event-based teaching, game jams, hackathons, high impact practices, steam, stem, transdisciplinary practices",10.1145/3017680.3022367,2017,1
inproceedings,Hackathons as a Pedagogical Strategy to Engage Students to Learn and to Adopt Software Engineering Practices,"Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.","Steglich, Caio and Salerno, Larissa and Fernandes, Tha\'{\i}s and Marczak, Sabrina and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana Paula and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio","Case Study, Educational Hackathon, Software Engineering Education, Student Motivation",10.1145/3422392.3422479,2020,10
