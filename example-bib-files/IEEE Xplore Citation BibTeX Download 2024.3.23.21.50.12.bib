  abstract={Nothing improves data science like a demanding decision‐maker, one who is striving to become data‐driven, who wants to bring as much data and data science as possible to bear and constantly expects data scientists to deliver more. This chapter presents the first exercise of waist measurement with rope, which aims to help decision‐makers appreciate how difficult even the simplest measurement can be and is usually great fun. The second exercise aims to help participants develop a deeper appreciation for data science and is considerably more demanding. Finally, the starter set of questions aims to help decision‐makers ask good questions. The real work of data scientists and chief analytics officers involves helping colleagues and decision‐makers grow more comfortable with data science. Thus, teach them the basics in easy, engaging ways when one can and confront more difficult issues as opportunity permits.},

  abstract={With a teaching/learning model constantly revisited in Spain and in practically all Europe, innovation in the teaching practice is part of the essence of the current models of teacher training. On that premise, we have collaborated with a group of permanent training advisers to identify the most widely used training typologies. At the same time we have analysed a typology that can bring together the best features of the other two in order to fulfil the necessities of teachers. This article shows a part of that process, presenting the strengths and weaknesses of the training based on blended learning and collecting the valuable contributions of professionals dedicated to these subjects. From the results we can compare the similarities between the major studies conducted up to the present and the people who implement such actions on daily basis.},

The major issues and challenges encountered in transforming the course from a traditional "instructors only" format into a team effort between the instructors and the GTAs are addressed. A training session developed by the department prior to the beginning of the fall semester, weekly meetings as well as occasional training sessions held throughout the semester is also discussed. The introduction of the GTAs provided opportunities for mentorship, improved teaching pedagogy, and the introduction of several innovative hands-on educational activities. Assessment data gathered through surveys and clicker questions in lecture is presented},

In the virtual space, teachers use the platform to teach sports and health care, communicate with students, and formulate corresponding methods for common problems such as video knowledge points on the Internet to further promote the effective implementation of education. At the same time, adopting multiple evaluation modes such as the combination of process evaluation and result evaluation, increasing the reward mechanism of the learning process, can improve the fairness of evaluation and also enhance students’ learning enthusiasm. And through questionnaire surveys, interviews to optimize the improvement effect of SPOC flipped classroom real space and virtual space. After the combination of VR and flipped classroom, student satisfaction rose from 4.19 to 4.6486. The research results show that the flipped classroom teaching method based on VR technology realizes the fair distribution of teaching resources and the differential distribution of personalized teaching resources. The comprehensive ability of students has been significantly improved, and the diversification of teaching evaluation models has been realized.},

However, the importance of these controllers is often overlooked as they are hidden or embedded within the systems that they aim to control. Examples and applications include the numerous feedback loops employed in electrical, mechanical and chemical systems and also those present in nature, such as the circadian cycle. Considering the wide array of exciting control engineering problems, it is surprising that there is an apparent lack of engaging and illustrative experiments that could be used in laboratories that support the teaching of control systems. This paper summarises an undergraduate final year group project which aimed to develop a series of laboratory experiments to support the teaching of control systems at the University of Manchester.},

  abstract={Software development organizations focus their efforts and invest resources on improving their processes and motivating their teams. The goal of this initiative is to develop high quality software products; however, some difficulties related to the learning process can be found in the dynamics interactions of the professional teams within the organization. A potential cause for these difficulties can be attributed to the use and implementation of teaching methodologies with lower levels of team member motivation. Gamification offers a possible solution for these deficiencies providing more thought-provoking environments for the learning experience. In this paper we propose a teaching instrument based on the principles of gamification to achieve a required level of motivation in teams involved in process improvement. Thus, motivation makes possible a successful implementation of the continuous improvement cycle in software development organizations.},
