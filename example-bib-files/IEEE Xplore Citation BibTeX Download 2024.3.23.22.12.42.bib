  abstract={Throughout history, society has faced different kinds of problems in all ways; from wars, poverty, climate change, natural phenomena up to mortal diseases. These afflictions have managed to get in people’s lives in a devastating way causing a great number of deaths due to pandemics such as the COVID-19, which has been, until the present days, an overwhelming enemy for almost all the countries in the world. This pandemic has forced society to adapt to a different lifestyle in order to face the virus and be alert and protected in any environment. In the education system, teachers were forced to move from traditional education to online education which involves the use of technologies at all times. This action has contributed to teachers and students’ physical and mental burnout causing mental or physical problems. This article will present a comparative analysis of the physical and psychosocial conditions that appeared during the traditional teaching and the online teaching in a group of teachers at the Universidad tecnológica de Torreón, as well as the repercussions in their lives and possible solution alternatives for their conditions.},

Jiangxi Normal University's School of Software participated in a lot of software contests and obtained a certain achievement. With the aim of combining the software events with teaching activity, while the requirements of teaching scheme are completed, we improve the students' operative ability and employability by stimulating their interest in learning. We introduced the training model named "promoting teaching by competition, combining teaching with competition" to our software training strategy, and yielded good effects through enhancing the students' creative spirit and practical ability.},

That belief is challenged in this workshop as the facilitator, who has taught presentations online for well over a decade, shares best practices, sample activities, assignments, and rubrics, as she walks participants through how to design their own online presentation course for to target specific audiences.},

  abstract={Approximately 40% of those who begin college with the intention of undertaking engineering do not complete their programs of undergraduate studies indicating that in the case of engineering studies, a central problem is one of persistence. In these classrooms and lecture halls, faculty may, or may not, realize the critical role they play in a student's decision to persist in engineering studies. Undoubtedly, classroom dynamics may exert tremendous influence on students' academic persistence or willingness to sustain the necessary effort to excel in their subjects. In Seymour and Hewitt's book, the high attrition rates for science, math and engineering students is linked to the intimidating nature of the classroom, the dullness of the lecture model and inadequate faculty guidance. To test this previous research, we measure two aspects of effective teaching, interpersonal rapport and teaching skills, on self-efficacy and academic confidence. In the future research, we will build and test a structural equation model to show the relationship of these variables on student performance.},

  abstract={A pluralistic, efficient, and convenient teaching strategy was carried out to assist teachers and students for study. Conventional teaching methods can equip most students with rich theoretical knowledge, but we also ignore the significance of operational ability. We collected online questionnaires to analyze the demands of medical students for teaching aid model assistance, and compared the results of whether 3D printing was applied in teaching. The results show that the combination of 3D printing with OBE and Aesthetic education concept can not only cultivate students' innovative thinking and comprehensive skills, but also effectively stimulate students' interest in learning and improve the quality of teaching.},

  abstract={From 1992 to 1998, an Engineering Concepts course was taught to first year students at the University of Virginia (UVa). In that time, enrolments increased from 250 students to over 500 each fall. As the course grew, we employed a team of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) to provide individual and small group learning experiences. Over 50 students served as GTAs during the life of the course. They varied greatly in communication skills and teaching effectiveness. From 1994 to 1998, we compiled data on all aspects of this course, including ratings for individual faculty and GTAs. What makes a successful GTA? Why do some students fail to perform well? We reflect on our experiences with these graduate students and their contributions to this course. We also report the results of surveys of their students. There were some surprises, faculty members cannot always predict who will do well and who will fail as teachers. The issues raised by the undergraduate students in evaluating their GTAs are not always what we expect.},

The Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education (USA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign sponsors programs for faculty, teaching assistants (TAs) and students to promote best practices in engineering education. This summary proposes a session to describe the authors' main programs for TAs: (1) the TA Teaching Academy; (2) the TA Peer-Observation and Mentoring Program; and (3) the Summer Teaching Institute. TAs are often in new situations that require different skills to successfully manage their roles as engineering TAs. Additional resources and support at the college level can enhance the effectiveness of campus-wide orientations and programs for the development of new TAs.},

In conventional works, teaching trajectory is identified by physical indicator like button. In this work, F/T sensor attached to the end-effector to detect the contact force is utilized. F/T sensor at the end-effector is attached to measure contact force for impedance control to make operator feel no resistance while direct teaching, not for teaching trajectory extraction. Here, exact teaching trajectory is extracted without additional physical device to manipulator.},
