Abstract = {Over last few decades, innovation became one of the most meaningful
   resources for successful management. In order to spark invention, the
   first step of innovation, a number of methods have been introduced
   including hackathon. This paper evaluates 14 hackathons over a period of
   over 3 years from various perspectives and with an ethnographic approach
   and different research methods- observation, 36 semi-structured
   interviews and netnography. Material analysis has been performed with
   methods of grounder theory, as well as machine learning as a
   triangulation method. As a result, types and approaches of hackathon,
   together with a new empirical definition, ways of how this method
   mitigates drawbacks of brain storming and a unique relationship between
   concepts of preparation difficulty and likelihood of desired invention
   at the hackathon have been introduced and presented.},

Abstract = {Internet routes controlled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) carry
   our communication and our commerce, yet many aspects of routing are
   opaque to even network operators, and BGP is known to contribute to
   performance, reliability, and security problems. The research and
   operations communities have developed a set of tools and data sources
   for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on February 2016 we
   organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live measurement and
   monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included students,
   researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding agencies,
   working together on projects to measure, visualize, and improve routing
   or the tools we use to study routing. This report describes the tools
   used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of the projects. The
   Hackathon was a success, and we look forward to future iterations.},

Abstract = {To develop the next generation of healthcare innovators, students at all
   levels of education should be trained and encouraged to employ
   innovative and entrepreneurial approaches to deal with complicated
   challenges of today's health system. Applying innovation and
   entrepreneurship training to solve complex problems and focus on
   solution design has recently become common in medical universities all
   over the world. This paper clarifies the role of hackathons as an
   innovative educational approach in healthcare education systems. We
   propose a process model concerned with organizing hackathon events in
   the healthcare education system. This model can be used in the academic
   and practical design of hackathons for innovation purposes.},

Abstract = {Background: Hackathons are organized to bring together both experienced
   and novice individuals from a variety of backgrounds to brainstorm
   creative solutions to complex issues. Hackathons may last from a few
   hours to a few days and may provide rewards for winning entries.
   Purpose: In this article, we describe an experience with a scientific
   hackathon at an international nursing research congress in Calgary,
   Canada. We discuss the purpose, process, benefits, and challenges of
   this hackathon.
   Approach: For this article, we have used a descriptive approach.
   Outcomes: The scientific hackathon experience united international
   nursing scholars unity with a common focus enabling the continuation of
   mutual, future endeavors.
   Conclusion: Hackathons are a means of connecting novices and experts
   from different backgrounds to develop technology-based solutions for
   health care issues. The ideas generated at hackathons may be further
   developed to bring the project to fruition to positively impact health
   care.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a large-scale virtual hackathon where we
   observed the way participants found collaborators and undertook
   innovation processes entirely in the virtual world. As an emerging
   social-technical practice, the virtual hackathon leverages the power of
   familiar strangers, the improvisation of low-cost digital services, and
   the crowdsourcing mechanism to enable open innovation under the
   constraint of physical distancing. This study contributes to the
   research by introducing and conceptualizing a modified artifact -
   virtual hackathon. The implication of and the lessons learnt from the
   virtual hackathon are applicable and generalizable to organizations when
   managing virtual collaborations, digital infrastructure, and open
   innovation.},

   of an Introduction to Global Health' undergraduate course in order to
   enable students to gain and create knowledge about specific global
   health-related challenges and, simultaneously, to acquire tangible and
   transferable skills. We provide a critical evaluation of our practice by
   drawing on relevant academic literature concerned with IBL, course
   material to describe the hackathon and its related components and
   outputs, and student evaluations to reflect on the overall module
   experience. We conclude by sharing reflections and recommendations of
   necessary measures required to institutionalize IBL in a more
   sustainable manner in higher education institutions.},

Title = {Motivating innovative education methods with hackathon attendance},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 10},
Abstract = {Hackathon has been growing and taking various industries by storm thanks
   to its flexibility and ability to fit into them. It has been proven
   successful and helpful in solving different IT and non-IT challenges.
   They also serve as an intriguing educational and networking tool,
   encouraging people to pursue innovative studies and activities. However,
   a hackathon is like a two-edged sword with its downsides - it requires
   significant investment and can fail if mismanaged. It is critical to
   recruit and gather participants suitable to face a particular
   technological or non-technological challenge and to motivate a group to
   perform innovative action and benefit from the learning-by-doing
   approach. This paper identifies 21 reasons to attend hackathons backed
   by existing research and presents a study conducted on 109 hackathon
   participants that help to score, rank and explain those attributes.
   Results have proven the importance of challenge and networking over
   monetary prizes and glory.},

Abstract = {The quest for invention has become crucial for the economic development,
   with the rise of IT technologies and the process of innovation becoming
   shorter. Hackathon has proven to be a novel invention development
   method, yet its popularity posed a major challenge of standardization
   and management. This paper analyses research performed on 14 hackathons,
   which leads to a deeper understating of processes within the hackathon
   method. An introduction to the relationship between hackathon
   approaches, types, and invention development process are presented. The
   hackathon invention framework and the hackathon equilibrium management
   concept are introduced allowing for the understanding of how different
   preparations and decisions may determine the expectations and the
   probability of the desired invention as the result of the hackathon.},

Abstract = {A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer
   hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by
   problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop
   creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the
   evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed
   practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57)
   developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented
   in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5),
   evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The
   evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon
   promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of
   concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged
   were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred
   that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More
   research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of
   social work curricula including the teaching of various research
   methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work
   profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt
   social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and
   e-consultation might benefit from Hackathon brainstorming.},

Abstract = {The hackathon was developed by practitioners and it could be said that
   they used structures and characteristics from other invention
   development methods that intend to spark creativity. This paper aims to
   define and evaluate those characteristics that serve as determinants of
   invention. It analyses research performed on 14 different hackathons
   with the following ethnographic approach: 1000 h of observation, 36
   semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography (netnography).
   Collected data has been analysed with the use of grounded theory methods
   and machine learning, which has been introduced as a triangulation
   method. As a result 9 main characteristics within the hackathon method
   that serve as invention determinants were discovered and holistically
   described. The identified elements have been backed by different
   theoretical backgrounds, but as one they form a flexible and unique
   mixture that helps to understand the hackathon phenomenon, potential
   hazards and its inner mechanisms. The discovered characteristics can
   help in effective organization of hackathons in the future.},

   Choice of Courses and Hackathon-Based Teaching},
Journal = {HUMAN ARENAS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the role of universities is experiencing a conflict:
   institutions need certificated and specialized professionals, and
   students need real knowledge. One hardly could imagine the
   implementation of this combination in the higher education system, even
   at the beginning of the university career. Bachelor's programs indeed
   tend to be overly specialized and dogmatic, careless of those creative
   processes underlying innovation. For these reasons, I suggest two
   innovations to rebalance the strife. The first consists of the
   possibility for each student to actively choose courses, thus creating
   personalized and heterogeneous study careers. The second innovation
   concerns the implementation of hackathon-based teaching to enrich
   learning through cooperation and competition to solve concrete problems.
   I suggest that these improvements would guarantee the formation of
   professionals and allow students to develop actively their system of
   knowledge, as well as they would break down the barriers to innovation
   in higher education.},

Title = {The 2006 NESCent Phyloinformatics Hackathon: A Field Report},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {287-296},
Abstract = {In December, 2006, a group of 26 software developers from some of the
   most widely used life science programming toolkits and phylogenetic
   software projects converged on Durham, North Carolina, for a
   Phyloinformatics Hackathon, an intense five-day collaborative software
   coding event sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
   (NESCent). The goal was to help researchers to integrate multiple
   phylogenetic software tools into automated workflows. Participants
   addressed deficiencies in interoperability between programs by
   implementing ``glue code{''} and improving support for phylogenetic data
   exchange standards (particularly NEXUS) across the toolkits. The work
   was guided by use-cases compiled in advance by both developers and
   users, and the code was documented as it was developed. The resulting
   software is freely available for both users and developers through
   incorporation into the distributions of several widely-used open-source
   toolkits. We explain the motivation for the hackathon, how it was
   organized, and discuss some of the outcomes and lessons learned. We
   conclude that hackathons are an effective mode of solving problems in
   software interoperability and usability, and are underutilized in
   scientific software development.},

Abstract = {African genomic medicine and microbiome datasets are usually not well
   characterized in terms of their origin, making it difficult to find and
   extract data for specific African ethnic groups or even countries. The
   Pan-African H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) recognized the
   need for developing data portals for African genomic medicine and
   African microbiomes to address this and ran a hackathon to initiate
   their development. The two portals were designed and significant
   progress was made in their development during the hackathon. All the
   participants worked in a very synergistic and collaborative atmosphere
   in order to achieve the hackathon's goals. The participants were divided
   into content and technical teams and worked over a period of 6 days. In
   response to one of the survey questions of what the participants liked
   the most during the hackathon, 55\% of the hackathon participants
   highlighted the familial and friendly atmosphere, the team work and the
   diversity of team members and their expertise. This paper describes the
   preparations for the portals hackathon and the interaction between the
   participants and reflects upon the lessons learned about its impact on
   successfully developing the two data portals as well as building
   scientific expertise of younger African researchers.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: The need for disruptive innovation within the
   pharmacy profession is well documented in the literature. However, there
   is a lack of proper training on innovation and creative thinking for
   student pharmacists and limited time or incentive for health care
   practitioners to be innovative. Hosting an innovation event, such as a
   hackathon, can teach innovative strategies and incentivize innovation by
   student pharmacists. Thus, the aim of this study was to to assess the
   feasibility and student perception of an inaugural school of pharmacy
   hackathon pilot. Educational activity and setting: A hackathon pilot was
   planned on a distant site campus. Over the course of four months, a
   planning team, consisting of a faculty member and a student leader in
   the American Pharmacy Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists, met
   every other week to plan the event. Outcomes included: change in student
   excitement and interest related to the hackathon, number of
   participants, and change in student confidence in the ability to perform
   steps in the innovation process. Findings: The average level of
   excitement prior to the event increased, and student confidence related
   to the ability to perform each step in the innovation process improved.
   Additionally, students agreed that they would be interested in attending
   a similar event in the future and would recommend the event to a friend.
   Summary: Hosting a healthcare hackathon at a school of pharmacy is an
   enjoyable way for pharmacy students to practice and gain confidence with
   innovation skills while addressing Accreditation Council for Pharmacy
   Education Standard 4.3.},

Abstract = {The National Science Foundation (NSF) 2018 Materials and Data Science
   Hackathon (MATDAT18) took place at the Residence Inn Alexandria Old
   Town/Duke Street, Alexandria, VA over the period May 30-June 1, 2018.
   This three-day collaborative ``hackathon{''} or ``datathon{''} brought
   together teams of materials scientists and data scientists to
   collaboratively engage materials science problems using data science
   tools. The materials scientists brought a diversity of problems ranging
   from inorganic material bandgap prediction to acceleration of ab initio
   molecular dynamics to quantification of aneurysm risk from blood
   hydrodynamics. The data scientists contributed tools and expertise in
   areas such as deep learning, Gaussian process regression, and sequential
   learning with which to engage these problems. Participants lived and
   worked together, collaboratively ``hacked{''} for several hours per day,
   delivered introductory, midpoint, and final presentations and were
   exposed to presentations and informal interactions with NSF personnel.
   Social events were organized to facilitate interactions between teams.
   The primary outcomes of the event were to seed new collaborations
   between materials and data scientists and generate preliminary results.
   A separate competitive process enabled participants to apply for
   exploratory funding to continue work commenced at the hackathon.
   Anonymously surveyed participants reported a high level of satisfaction
   with the event, with 100\% of respondents indicating that their team
   will continue to work together into the future and 91\% reporting intent
   to submit a white paper for exploratory funding.},

Abstract = {In 2020 Pakistan's first-ever hackathon on school emergencies was
   organised, where schools and community stakeholders collaborated to
   deconstruct problems and develop solutions. The study aimed to
   investigate participants' motivation for and experiences of the
   hackathon. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from
   hackers, mentors, judges and organisers before, during and after the
   event. Findings indicate diversity amongst participants in terms of age,
   gender and experiences. The hackers' motivations were both intrinsic and
   extrinsic. The challenges were insufficient time, absence of investors,
   inconsistent mentoring, low participation from public schools and
   imbalanced gender participation. The hackathon provided a unique
   opportunity for multidisciplinary collaborative problem-solving and
   accessing experts for creativity and innovation. Future research should
   focus on increasing participation and fostering social innovations
   through school-based civic hackathons.},

Abstract = {Organizations-from academic and professional associations to private
   corporations and police forces-face challenges promoting diversity and
   inclusion among their workers and affiliates. Instead of training and
   regulations, recent research recommends mechanisms that engage managers
   and leaders in activities that involve behavioral changes. This article
   describes how we put the managerial engagement approach into practice by
   organizing a ``Diversity and Inclusion Hackathon{''} at the 2018 annual
   meeting of the American Political Science Association. With 11 teams
   focused on a range of topics, the hackathon attracted more than 200
   people and produced multiple outputs. It engaged scholars from a range
   of backgrounds, social identities, institutions, ranks, and beliefs in
   the generation of new norms, programmatic ideas, and plans for the
   profession. Although we cannot infer causality, analysis of the APSA
   Annual Meeting evaluation survey reveals that hackathon participants are
   significantly more likely to express positive perceptions of the
   conference.},

Abstract = {UNESCO World Heritage cities can become smart cities if they take into
   account their cultural heritage and integrate diverse actors, including
   universities in their innovation practices. This article addresses the
   hackathon as an innovation contest method in the urban and educational
   context. Specifically, it concentrates on hackathon design, particularly
   the focus of the event, as well as the outputs. Although the design
   plays an integral part in a hackathon, particularly in goal achievement,
   design has not yet been thoroughly studied in mainly descriptive
   hackathon research. To address the subject, this article presents a case
   study of a dual-focused, i.e., combined urban and educational hackathon
   in the City of Rauma, which has a World Heritage Old Town that aims to
   integrate its historical uniqueness with modern city services. As a
   result, the article portrays the process and outputs of a hackathon
   carried out with the collaboration of two higher education institutions
   (HEIs) and the Entrepreneur Association of Rauma. Presenting conclusions
   for both academics and the public sector, the article contributes to the
   literature on urban and educational hackathons in smart cities with a
   heritage context.},

   stroke. Method: The Hackathon was held during a Brazilian Student's
   union (BRASA) congress involving students from engineering and other
   technological disciplines. Results: Four teamscompleted the 24-hour
   challenge; two teams opted the stroke challenge. One team proposed
   improving detection using a mobile sensor Fit-Bit combined with a
   smart-phone to contact emergency dispatch. The other team developed a
   game, in which kids would play a role as a neurologist; to diagnosis
   stroke with objective to increase awareness. Conclusion: Hackathons can

Title = {An Extended Hackathon Model for Collaborative Education in Medical
   Innovation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To support the next generation of healthcare innovators - whether they
   be engineers, designers, clinicians, or business experts by training -
   education in the emerging field of medical innovation should be made
   easily and widely accessible to undergraduate students, graduate
   students, and young professionals, early in their careers. Currently,
   medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or
   year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a
   limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure
   and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that
   seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible
   and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended
   hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245
   participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016,
   2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo
   Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to
   self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were
   administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants
   hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of
   expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161)
   saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1\%, P<0.001) from their pre-
   to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is
   presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and
   graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation.
   Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten
   categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of
   extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation
   knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of
   participants surveyed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: There is a growing literature demonstrating the benefits
   of engaging knowledge-users throughout the research process. We engaged
   a multi-stakeholder team to undertake a hackathon as part of an
   integrated knowledge translation (iKT) process to develop
   nonpharmacological interventions to enhance the economic lives of people
   with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aims of this research were
   to (1) increase understanding of the economic challenges of living with
   SLE through stakeholder engagement at a research hackathon; (2)
   investigate possible interventions to improve the economic lives of
   individuals affected by SLE in Canada; and (3) document the outcomes of
   the Waterlupus hackathon.
   Methods: Waterlupus was held at the University of Waterloo in May 2019,
   attended by lupus advocacy organization representatives, researchers,
   physicians, individuals with lived experience and students. We conducted
   participant observation with participants' understanding and consent;
   notes from the hackathon were qualitatively analyzed to document
   hackathon outcomes.
   Results: At the conclusion of the 28-hour hackathon event, five teams
   pitched nonpharmacological interventions to address the economic
   challenges of living with SLE. The winning team's pitch focussed on
   increasing accessibility of affordable sun-protective clothing. Other
   Waterlupus outcomes include increased awareness of SLE among
   participants, and professional and informal networking opportunities.
   Conclusion: This paper contributes to a limited literature on health
   hackathons. The successful outcomes of Waterlupus emphasize the value of
   hackathons as an iKT tool. Research about how knowledge-users perceive
   hackathons is an important next step.},

Abstract = {Background: Health care challenges are increasingly complex. Nursing
   student involvement in hackathons can help create a sustainable culture
   of innovation and leadership within nursing. Purpose: To host and
   evaluate the inaugural Innovate 4 Change Hackathon.Methods: Nursing
   student-led interdisciplinary teams worked together for 5 weeks to solve
   pressing health care problems, ultimately pitching ideas for
   prizes.Findings: Seven teams with 33 students represented multiple
   disciplines. For nearly 70\% of participants, hackathons were a new
   experience. Nursing students were on every team, representing 50\% of
   the participants.Discussion: Nurse-led hackathons help students gain
   experience in innovative problem-solving and elevate confidence. They
   provide a structured format to learn about nursing innovation, design
   thinking, and business models while also challenging students to address
   problems related to health equity, clinical care, health care delivery,
   and policy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public
   engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity
   over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In
   this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited
   designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design
   Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their
   care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from
   designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in
   representing and involving peoplewith dementia in these events, which
   had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis
   presents insights into participants' motivations, challenges
   participants faced when constructing their ``absent user{''}, and the
   design features teams developed to address the social context of the
   user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for
   collaborative design events, community building through design, and
   reification in design.},

Title = {Consider ``HACKS{''} when designing hackathon challenges: Hook, action,
   collaborative knowledge sharing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Our world's complex challenges increase the need for those entering
   STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) disciplines to
   be able to creatively approach and collaboratively address wicked
   problems - complex problems with no ``right `` answer that span
   disciplines. Hackathons are environments that leverage problem-based
   learning practices so student teams can solve problems creatively and
   collaboratively by developing a solution to given challenges using
   engineering and computer science knowledge, skills, and abilities. The
   purpose of this paper is to offer a framework for interdisciplinary
   hackathon challenge development, as well as provide resources to aid
   interdisciplinary teams in better understanding the context and needs of
   a hackathon to evaluate and refine hackathon challenges. Three cohorts
   of interdisciplinary STEAM researchers were observed and interviewed as
   they collaboratively created a hackathon challenge incorporating all
   cohort-member disciplines for an online high school hackathon. The
   observation data and interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic
   analysis to distill the processes cohorts underwent and resources that
   were necessary for successfully creating a hackathon challenge. Through
   this research we found that the cohorts worked through four sequential
   stages as they collaborated to create a hackathon challenge. We detail
   the stages and offer them as a framework for future teams who seek to
   develop an interdisciplinary hackathon challenge. Additionally, we found
   that all cohorts lacked the knowledge and experience with hackathons to
   make fully informed decisions related to the challenge's topic, scope,
   outcomes, etc. In response, this manuscript offers five hackathon
   quality considerations and three guiding principles for challenge
   developers to best meet the needs and goals of hackathon sponsors and
   participants.},

Abstract = {Hackathon as a social event has been identified as a method that assists
   participants collaborate and solve technical design challenges in a
   limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance
   in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for
   teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for
   some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited
   to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to
   investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the
   academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research
   was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South
   African IT programming students. The results indicate that relative
   advantage (beta = 0.142, rho = 0.045), perceived usefulness (beta =
   0.205, rho = 0.036), performance expectancy (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.002)
   and self-efficacy (beta = 0.330, rho = 0.000) have a positive influence
   on the behavioural intention of students to adopt hackathon for learning
   IT programming. The hackathon adoption model was developed for higher
   education. This research helps in the adoption of hackathons in higher
   education.},

   sustain innovations in libraries. Method: It is characterized as a case
   study with valuable contributions to Library Science and related areas
   that are fundamental to other information units besides libraries, such
   as archives, museums, documentation centers, information centers, memory
   centers, among others. Results: The results were described based on the
   eight stages established in the design of the first edition of the FEBAB
   Hackathon for its remote version: Composition of the Organizing
   Committee; Definition of the guiding challenge (How can libraries be
   empowered as a third place to strengthen communities?); Obtaining
   sponsorship for the awards; Establishing the Rules of Procedure; Calling
   on people to collaborate as evaluators, mentors and support; Defining
   the methodology to be adopted for the co -creation dynamics;
   Establishing the hackathon schedule for registration, training,
   implementation, evaluation, feedback from participants, and sending
   certificates and; Selecting the technological tools to be used for the
   website, registration, document organization and interaction between
   participants. The event had 47 registrations and the actual
   participation of 19 people from the northeast, south and southeast. The
   predominant age group was 31 to 35. The predominant area of training was
   Library Science, which is explained by the fact that the challenge was
   aimed at libraries. The 19 participants were divided into 4 project
   development teams. Conclusions: The Library Science has a habit of
   positioning itself as an interdisciplinary science for historical
   reasons, due to the influence of the job market and the discourse put
   forward by training schools, but this doesn't always materialize. The
   hackathon, in essence, is an event that promotes multidisciplinarity due
   to the roles involved in developing the projects and which, in the end,
   is interdisciplinary. It represents an opportunity to connect people and
   ideas that in the future will not be limited to the duration of the
   event. It contributes to open innovation, bringing more visibility,
   effectiveness and viability to products, services, and information
   professionals. By leaving the academic environment, it also contributes
   to the development of the society involved in the proposed challenge.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to check the effectiveness of differentiated
   English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction using the hackathon.
   This study used the mixed research method. The participants of the study
   were 24 Information Technology (IT) students of the Physics and
   Technology Institute of National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor
   Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute{''} who voluntarily took part in the
   study in 2022-2023. They were divided into two experimental groups and
   differentiated according to the social roles and the level of English
   language proficiency. Sensory, interactive and graphic scaffolding as
   the temporary assistance was integrated in the educational process. As
   shown by the results of the experimental learning, the second group,
   where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of
   scaffolding use was defined by both students and teachers, demonstrated
   significantly better results than the first group, where the IT students
   performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was
   defined by IT students only. Scaffolding should be regulated by both the
   teacher and the students. It was concluded that the use of hackathon
   with a focus on learners' differentiation helps to diversify ESP
   learning at technical university and facilitates the development of
   professional communicative skills (speaking and writing) as well as
   other soft and hard skills.},
